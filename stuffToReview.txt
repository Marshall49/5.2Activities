  1. What are the six basic data types in Javascript?

  2. What is a function?

  3. What is an object?

  4. What is the difference between a function and a method? (kind of a trick question because technically a method is a function)

  5. what are parameters(arguments, these are literally the exact same thing)?

  6. What does it mean to store something in a variable?

  7. How does scope work?
